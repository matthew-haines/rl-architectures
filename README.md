# Reinforcement Learning Architectures
This is a collection of deep q-learning models built with PyTorch. Different agents are defined in `DDQN.py, DDQN_prioritized.py, DQN.py, DQN_prioritized.py, DQN_replay.py, DQN_target.py` with shared neural networks defined in `networks.py` and an implementation of prioritized experience replay defined in `replay.py`.

Metrics are logged using TensorBoard during training.
